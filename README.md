# Sequential Flow Model (SFM)

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a68b8c7-c052-47ec-b7a4-d43da045c241" />

This repository introduces and demonstrates the **Sequential Flow Model (SFM)** — a modular, deterministic, and stackless control flow execution model based on linear steps and explicit transitions.

It includes:
- Minimal code examples and reference implementations
- A persistent execution context design
- `call` and `jump` semantics with step-by-step logic

The **complete theoretical explanation and documentation** is maintained in the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**.

## Getting Started

Browse the `/examples` and `/core` folders for reference implementations.  
Refer to the **Wiki** for understanding the core principles and formal definitions of SFM.
